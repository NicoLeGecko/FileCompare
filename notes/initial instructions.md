# File Comparer

Your task is to implement a console application which takes a path to a directory and finds binary duplicates.
Two commands should be implemented, one that adds files in a directory to the db, and one that searches a directory for files that are already in the db.
The search implementation should output which files in the directory that had duplicates and the file names of the duplicate files.

The task is designed to not take more than 4 hours. To use internet to solve your problem is encouraged but
keep in mind that you will be asked to explain your implementation. The discussion around the code is more
important than the code itself.

The implementation should be written in C# for .NET and the solution should include tests.

Happy Programming!
